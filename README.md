# ESX

ESX v1, Hawaii Edition. Just got screwed on the internet for the last time, so here's my continued efforts to improve ESX. After snake gizz kicked me off he merged PRs with no standard, and done other things making it worse, then abandoned it for his v2 and I'll let y'all keep speculating why he isn't ever online anymore 🔪 🐍

The point of this repo is not to replace the mainstream ESX installation, ever. It's intended to teach people of improvements that could be made to the framework. I'll keep making breaking changes to improve the framework. Improvements made are mainly optimizations so you can run >100 players with it, which you definitely cannot run with the original code.

It also doesn't come with a inventory since you shouldn't be using that garbage UI for that, make a real one.

For OGs I made a **development** discord, not some 'help' discord and not for people who don't know code: https://discord.gg/H86eaEPwvK

## Improvements over ESX

- Server performance improvements, such as saving player data
- Supports multiple character scripts such as kashacters
- Supports multiple groups
- Vehicles don't despawn ever
